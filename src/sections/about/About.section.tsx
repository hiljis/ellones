				We are a web3 plattform focusing on providing information and data on the digital assets space - mainly
				layer 1 protocols. Our goal is to make web3 accessible, fun and easy to understand using simplistic
				design.

			<p className="section__about__text">
				There are thousands of different crypto projects and tokens, and most are sadly scams. We focus on the
				ones that really matter - the base layer protols. These are the foundation for the future of digital
				assets, so why not just focus on them?
